# LSTM Nasdaq Stock prediction

This project involves testing out standard machine learning algorithms and long short term memory networks to predict nasdaq prices. The "lstm.py" code is taken from Jakob Aungiers's website (http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction). You will find the code for training and testing in "capstone.py"
