# LSTM Nasdaq Stock prediction

This project involves testing out standard machine learning algorithms and long short term memory networks to predict nasdaq prices.

# Installation
You will need python 3.6 and the following python packages installed. Most of these come with anaconda, except for sklearn.

1. sklearn
2. time
3. pandas
4. numpy
5. IPython
Furthermore you will also need helper code lstm.py, which is taken from http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction
# Motivation

# Files
1. Nasdaq.csv: Original csv taken from yahoo
2. NasdaqC.csv: Modified original data for the lstm to use
3. lstm.py: helper code to preprocess data
4. capstone.py: code for training and testing machine learning algorithms
